# User Authentication System

The User Authentication System is a secure and reliable mechanism designed to verify user identities and control access to protected resources. It provides a robust solution for authenticating users and ensuring that only authorized individuals can access the system, application, or website.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Sign up and log in securely to the User Authentication System.
- **Token-Based Authentication:** Use tokens for authentication and session management.
- **User Identification:** Register and authenticate users using their email addresses.
- **Access Control:** Grant authorized access to protected resources based on user authentication.
- **Secure Communication:** Implement secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS) to protect user credentials and sensitive data.

## Tech Stack

- JavaScript: Programming language used for server-side and client-side development.
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime for server-side application development.
- Express: Web application framework for building robust and scalable apps.
- MongoDB: NoSQL document database for flexible and scalable data storage.
- Mongoose: Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- EJS: Templating engine for generating dynamic HTML content.

1.  Clone the repository:

    `git clone https://github.com/Amaan-Uddin/User-Authentication-System.git`

2.  Install dependencies:

    `cd User-Authentication-System`

    `npm install`

3.  Set up the MongoDB connection:

    - Ensure you have MongoDB installed and running.
    - Update the MongoDB connection URL in the project's configuration file.

4.  Configure JWT tokens:

    - Generate an access token secret and refresh token secret.
    - Update the JWT configuration in the project's configuration file, including the secret keys.

5.  Start the server:

    `npm start`

6.  Open your web browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) to access the User Authentication System.

## Note:

Please note that when running the code on your local machine, it is important to set up an `.env` file with all the required configurations. This file should include the following information:

- `DATABASE_URI`: The URI or path to your MongoDB database.
- `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`: The secret key used for generating access tokens.
- `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET`: The secret key used for generating refresh tokens.
- `REMEMBER_TOKEN_SECRET`: The secret key used for generating remember tokens.
- `EMAIL_ADD`: The email address used for sending email notifications.
- `PASSWORD`: The password for the above email address, used for authentication in nodemailer syntax.

Make sure to set the values for these configurations in your `.env` file before running the User Authentication System on your local machine.
